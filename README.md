## Welcome to my Gihub profile! ðŸ‘‹



- My interests are in *Data Science*, *NLP*, *Language Learning* and everything in between!


- I primarily program with `Python`, `R` and `SQL`, along with the many opensource libraries available to them. I also use **BI** tools such as `Tableau` and `Google Sheets`.
